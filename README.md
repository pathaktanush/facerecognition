As we see when we run the code the first thing that pops up is the main menu.

As we click the 'live' button , the webcam starts up and begins comparing the image provided with the face in front of the webcam.
If the images tend to be alike , it gives us the output as shown.
If the people in the images are different , the output changes as we see in the reference image.

The software is also capable of scanning an image through your webcam and through your phone.
For example , Over here I have placed an image on my phone side by side with myself and it gives output for both.
