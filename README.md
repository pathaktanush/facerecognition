As you can see , I have given an image of Bill gates in the code as well as his name.The webcam then scans the person in front of it and compares it with the image.

As we can see , I do not resemble Bill Gates and hence it reports 'unknown'.

Over here I changed the inputs to an image of myself and my name.
Now , as I resemble the image it gives the desirable output as my name.

The software is also capable of scanning an image through your webcam and through your phone.
For example , Over here I had the my input image and my name , it scanned both the webcam and the mobile image and gave desirable out comes for each of them.
